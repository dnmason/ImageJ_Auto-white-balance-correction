**White balance correction_1.0**

Summary and Methods:

Images from colour camera always need white balance adjustment which is usually performed just before the acquisition. This is due to the fact that the light source doesn’t emit pure white light.
The calibration of the camera might not lead to a perfect result, or you might have forgotten to adjust the white balance during your acquisition… Then you need to correct this with a software dedicated tool.
I suggest here to use the attached macro written for ImageJ / Fiji to automatically adjust the white balance of your images. All you need is a background area in your image.
Original macro was written by Vytas Bindokas; Oct 2006, Univ. of Chicago.

Methods:

1. Open your image with ImageJ / Fiji 

2. Drag & drop the macro file on menu window

3. Click “Run” and follow the instructions
